This is a personal creative project that I've been working on-and-off for some time, and finished in February 2021. 
It is a creative spin on the traditional Pong game, however, this time, there are a few fun twists.

There is a main menu from which the player can access the game, settings (to change the colour of the game), how to play instructions, and high scores (this is where high scores are saved on the user hardware). 
Moreover, the game includes 1P mode against an easy, medium, and hard bot, as well as a 2P mode option. 
Furthermore, there is an arcade mode which spawns a mystery box after 5 seconds of play, and randomly throughout the rest of the game. 
When the ball hits the mystery box, then one of three special effects are activated: Rainbow Land, Super Speed, and Mirror. 
Rainbow Land changes the colour of the background of the game every 0.5 seconds for a total of 6 seconds. 
Super speed increases the speed of the ball massively. And Mirror, well, it reverses up and down controls for the player. 
In addition to all this, the player can pause the game anytime by pressing the "esc" button, and from there either resume the game or go back to the main menu.

Included in this file is a quick documentation giving a brief overview of key insights in how the game was programmed. 
I am sorry if it is not too extensive and/or poorly explains the concepts, I am not too experienced with writing documentations. 
That said, I've added comments all throughout the program to better explain the topics. 
Also included is a pdf file of screenshots taken from key moments in the game. This is so that you can a quick view what the game is like without loading the file.

If there are any issues with running the file, it is most likely due to several factors: (1) please download pygame library, 
(2) accessing the font-style file and the rtf for saving the high scores. 
For the first one, you will have to download pygame to run this game. 
For the second one, to fix this issue, you will most likely have to change the "font path" variable on line 12 to a specified path on your computer. 
An example in my code is "/Users/aibek/Desktop/Pong_2.0v/PressStart2P.ttf". Change this to your path directory.
If you are still experiencing problems, try changing the rtf directory path in lines 88, 837, and 872. If you are still experiencing issues, please message me.

All in all, I hope you like this game. 
If you like to see a quick overview of how the game is run, please view the video on youtube I made going over it at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BFlwDmZH_E\
Sorry that the video is rushed, I was trying to make it shorter, and that my voice sounds much more high pitch than usual. 

All the best!
Aibek
