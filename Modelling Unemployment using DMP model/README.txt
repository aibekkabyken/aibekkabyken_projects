This is part of my work for my undergraduate dissertation. I have cut off some academic sections to not bore the reader with the economic history and peculiarities of the subject, rather to focus on the math and programming part. In the PDF document is the mathematical derivation of my model. Based on the equations derived from there, I was able to use Python to predict the impact of sponsored-worker foreign minimum wage policy on UK graduate unemployment (see limitations in the document). Furthermore, attached is:

(1) The summary dataset from HESA Graduate Outcomes under the name 'graduate_salaries.csv'

(2) The cleaned dataset under the name 'wages.csv'

(3)  The main python script used to calibrate and solve the model named 'RAE_model_model'

(4) The data cleaning python script used to derive the cleaned dataset from the HESA Graduate Outcomes data named 'data_cleaning'

To run the python scripts, you need Python 3.0 as well as to install the scipy, pandas, numpy, simply, and matplotlib libraries. 

Hope you enjoy :)
